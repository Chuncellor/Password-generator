# Password-generator

About/Process:
For this challenge, we were tasked with creating a random password generator based on a set of starter-code which we were given. To begin, I added arrays in the JavaScript document to set the parameters for what the randomly generated password would be. I then used the function "buildPassword" to allow the user to select what they would like their password to include based on a set of pop-ups on screen. they could choose the length (between 8 and 128- as specified by the assignment criteria), and which characters they wanted to use in their password out of: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special charcaters, and numbers. This was easy to do thanks to the arrays I created at the beginning. I then used "if functions" to create a variable based on each selection made by the user. The key to creating a completely random selection of characters in this step was to use the math.random function in order to scramble the selected characters each time the generator is run. Finally, I added a variable to link the generate button to an eventListener function so the previous functions would run on click.
